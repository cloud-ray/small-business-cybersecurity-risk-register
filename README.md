## Overview

This project showcases a Small Business Risk Register and Risk Matrix, which I developed to assist businesses in identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks.

The Risk Register provides a structured approach to document a company’s current risks, identifying existing controls and proposed risk response actions, while the Risk Matrix helps to understand the potential impact and likelihood of each risk.

This project aims to highlight my skills as a cybersecurity analyst and auditor in assisting in effective risk management practices for small businesses.

## Background

As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize the critical importance of risk management in safeguarding businesses against cyber threats.

Understanding that small businesses often face unique challenges in this area, or are unaware of these methods, I set out to develop a practical Risk Register and Matrix tailored to their needs.

The goal was to create a user-friendly tool that helps small businesses contemplate potential threats to their business, and then identify and address these potential vulnerabilities effectively.
<br><br>

## Features

- A Risk Register template for businesses to document identified risks, their risk ratings, and proposed risk response actions.
- A Risk Matrix to visualize the potential impact and likelihood of each risk.
<br><br>

## Tools and Technologies

- Google Sheets
<br><br>

## How to Use

1. Access the Small Business Risk Register and Matrix via [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o9Prvcq1BnUyCBDhzB0bDuvQWECh8ZuqVMXXV_XAats/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Open the template and download or make a copy in Google Sheets.
3. Complete the self-assessment individually or as a team.
4. Determine the next steps in securing your business operations.

## Risk Assessment Process

The risk assessment process involves the following key steps:

1. Identifying Risks: Identify potential risks that your business may face in the realm of cybersecurity.

2. Assessing Risks: Evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of each identified risk and assign risk ratings.

3. Prioritizing Risks: Prioritize risks based on their risk ratings and their potential impact on your small business.

4. Developing Risk Response: Develop appropriate risk response actions to address and mitigate identified risks.

## Risk Register
<br>

![[[Cybersecurity Risk Register](https://github.com/cybersavvy0/small-business-cybersecurity-risk-register/blob/5287cf697ed10ae19117f9248fc16ca0f9524bdb/register-tool.jpg)]](https://github.com/cybersavvy0/small-business-cybersecurity-risk-register/blob/5287cf697ed10ae19117f9248fc16ca0f9524bdb/register-tool.jpg)
<br><br>

The Risk Register is a detailed template that allows small businesses to document identified risks, their risk ratings, risk responses, and other relevant details. By using this register, small businesses can systematically manage, monitor their cybersecurity risks, and adapt the template to their specific needs.
<br><br>

## Security Control Considerations

The Risk Register includes a range of security controls, including technical, operational, financial, information security, compliance and regulatory, and reputation controls.

Small businesses may not take compliance and regulatory considerations into account when contemplating associated risks. The following common compliance frameworks should be considered.

1. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard [(PCI DSS)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/): For small businesses processing credit card payments, PCI DSS compliance becomes imperative to ensure secure handling of cardholder data.

2. General Data Protection Regulation [(GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/): GDPR applies to businesses operating in or dealing with personal data of EU citizens, establishing stringent rules for data protection and privacy.

3. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [(HIPAA)](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/health-insurance-portability-accountability-act-1996): HIPAA pertains to healthcare providers and mandates robust safeguards for protecting patient health information.

## Risk Matrix
<br>

![[[Cybersecurity Risk Matrix](https://github.com/cybersavvy0/small-business-cybersecurity-risk-register/blob/5287cf697ed10ae19117f9248fc16ca0f9524bdb/register-matrix.jpg)]](https://github.com/cybersavvy0/small-business-cybersecurity-risk-register/blob/5287cf697ed10ae19117f9248fc16ca0f9524bdb/register-matrix.jpg)
<br><br>

The Risk Matrix provides a visual representation of the potential impact and likelihood of each risk identified in the Risk Register. The matrix helps to quickly identify high-priority risks that require immediate attention.

It is a 4x4 grid which gives more context to small businesses than a 3x3, but not as potentially overwhelming as a 5x5 grid.
